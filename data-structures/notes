WHAT ARE DATA-STRUCTURES

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operation that can be applied to the data.

WHY SO MANY?

Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) ar more generally used.

WHY CARE?

The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures
