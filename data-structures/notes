WHAT ARE DATA-STRUCTURES

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operation that can be applied to the data.

WHY SO MANY?

Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) ar more generally used.

WHY CARE?

The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures

Lists - Linear

Tree - nonLinear (only parent child relationship. All nodes are moving away from root node. No horizontal relationship)

ROOT - The top node in a Tree
CHILD - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
PARENT - The conversion notion of a child
SIBLINGS - a group of nodes with the same parent
LEAF - a node with no children
EDGE - the connection between one node and another

Tree real world concept
    - HTML DOM
    - Network Routing
    - Abstract Syntax Trees
    - Decision Tree AI
    - Folder in others
    - computer file system

Binary Search Tree
    - Every parent node has at most TWO children
    - Every node to the LEFT of a parent node is ALWAYS LESS than the parent node
    - Every node to the RIGHT of a parent node is ALWAYS GREATER than the parent node
